To replicate the map, follow the instructions in "R/master-script.R" and, of course, feel free to explore in depth the chunks of code in "R" directory.

## REPLICATION. HOW TO
1. Fork this repository or [unzip the archive][arch].
2. Using RStudio open "the-lancet-2018.Rproj" file in the main project directory.
3. Run the "R/master_script.R" file. 
Wait. That's it.
The results are stored in the directory "_output".

## LOGIC OF THE PROCESS
The whole process is split into four parts, which is reflected in the structure of R scripts. First, the steps required for reproducibility are taken. Second, we define own functions. Next, all data acquisition and manipulation steps are performed.Finally, the map is built. 
The names of the scripts are quite indicative, and each script is reasonably commented.
